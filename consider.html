                <li>Straight line speed is not a top priority of yours</li>
                <li>You have a second car or some other reliable form of transportation</li>

                <li>You're okay with the gas milage of a truck (I usually get ~15.3 mpg)</li>

                <li>You have no interest in learning how to drive a manual transmission car</li>
                <li>You want a car that is quick in a straight line and has power at low RPM</li>
                <li>You want a cheap car and think that the low purchase price means the ownership cost is therefore also low</li>
                <li>The RX-8 would be your only car/form of transportation</li>
                <li>You are uncomfortable doing your own maintenance</li>

            <h2>The bottom line is</h2>
            <p>RX-8s are absolutely a labor of love, and if you can't commit the time or energy to them they will let you down. You cannnot put off their maintenance intervals
                like you might on a Honda or a Toyota. However, you decide to take on the challenge of owning one, you'll be rewarded with one of the most engaging and fun cars to drive,
                regardless of price. As cliche as it is, there really is nothing like driving a Renesis engine up to 9k RPM.
