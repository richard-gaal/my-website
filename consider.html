                <li>You enjoy doing your own maintenance (because a lot of shops won't do it)</li>
                <li>You want to learn or already know how to drive stick</li>
                <li>Straight line speed is not a top priority of yours</li>
                <li>You have a second car or some other reliable form of transportation</li>
                <li>You have the income to buy proper parts and at the right time intervals</li>
                <li>You're okay with the gas milage of a truck (I usually get ~15.3 mpg)</li>

            <ul>
                <li>You want a perfectly reliable car that won't have any issues</li>
                <li>You want a car that is quick in a straight line and has power at low RPM</li>
                <li>You want a cheap car and think that the low purchase price indicates a low ownership cost</li>
                <li>The RX-8 would be your only car/form of transportation</li>
                <li>You are uncomfortable doing your own maintenance</li>

            <p>A RX-8 probably isn't the best car for you and you'll likely regret your purchase</p>

            <h2>The bottom line is</h2>
            <p>RX-8s are absolutely a labor of love, and if you can't commit the time or energy to them they will let you down. You cannnot put off their maintenance intervals
                like you might on a Honda or a Toyota. However, you decide to take on the challenge of owning one, you'll be rewarded with one of the most engaging and fun cars to drive,
                regardless of price. As cliche as it is, there really is nothing like driving a Renesis engine up to 9k RPM.
