        <main>
            <p>The Mazda RX-8 is a significant depature from all of the generations of the RX-7, but most distinctly from the last generation of RX-7, the FD. To maximize power and 
                torque, the 13B featured in the FD RX-7 had not one but two sequential turbochargers. While these had their own problems, (the turbos had a habit of having a very
                sudden switch, resulting in an unexpected power increase that could lead to unexpected loss of traction) the turbos defined the RX-7 line
                as a whole towards the end of its production.
            </p>
            <p>The FD RX-7 was iconic, between its performance and its looks, and as such the RX-8 had a lot to live up to as its successor. According to many, the RX-8 failed in 
                this goal. To improve emissions, out went the turbos and in came a revised version of the 13B. This revision of the 13B, known as the Renesis, moved the exhaust ports
                from being on the rotor housing (so the tip of the rotor swept across them) to the side housings. This was done to improve emissions and fuel economy, which sounds
                like a good thing!
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this came with several downsides. Exhaust scavenging suffered, as the exhaust route was more complicated compared to having the exhaust ports
                directly on the rotor housing. This in turn limited the ultimate power potential of the engine, meaning the RX-7 would not only be more powerful from the factory
                but had more tuning potential to unlock even more performance. And while the improved fuel economy was there, it wasn't significant enough to turn the RX-8 into a
                economy car. In some cases, the fuel economy between a FD RX-7 and a RX-8 is within the margin of error.
            </p>
            <p> It's not all doom and gloom for the Renesis however. From the factory the 6-port version has redline at 9K and the engine has no problem reaching it. The Renesis is also 
                effectively fully tuned from the factory, which means you don't have to spend time and money on tuning it yourself (although of course this is a downside if you 
                look forward to doing that process yourself). 
            </p>
            <p> The RX-8, with its many flaws, is significantly cheaper than just about any RX-7, regardless of generation, while being the most modern car to be powered only by a rotary.
                This means it a very good entry into owning a rotary car, despite the fact an RX-8 cannot treated the same as a RX-7. Regardless of the iteration, driving a rotary engine 
                is an experience matched by no other and (in my opinion) is worth putting up with the downsides of the engine.
