    </header>
    <!--Basic web page with a short text blurb, 2 images, and captions for the images-->
    <main>
        <p>The pages within this section will cover how a rotary engine works, some of the benefits of a rotary compared to a piston engine, some of the negatives, how the 13-MSP differs from the previous rotary engine,
            and why the rotary is perceived as unreliable in the popular zeitgeist. </p>
        <p>While most people don't need to know exactly how the engine in their car works to keep it reliable, the rotary engine is not most engines.
            Getting at least a basic understanding of how the engine works will not only help you keep it reliable (as much as possible that is) as well as help you maximize your enjoyment of the car.
