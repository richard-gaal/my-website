        <p>The rotary engine, while having its flaws, offers a driving experience like no other. This unique experience
            stems from the different manner a rotary engine
            goes about the combustion process. Both the standard piston engine and a rotary have four steps to
            combustion, those being: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Intake</li>
            <li>Compression</li>
            <li>Ignition</li>
            <li>Exhaust</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            However, rather than having to turn linear motion into rotational motion like a piston engine, a rotary
            engine rotates as its compression process. This leads to smoother acceleration, as the rotary engine doesn't have to deal with pistons 
            constantly accelerating in different directions, and in turn leads to less shifting mass within the engine as the car accelerates. The combustion process
            of a rotary engine is hard to convey with just words, so below is a comparsion between the rotary combustion process and the piston one.

        <p id="post_comp">As seen above, the rotary engine's combustion process is is already rotational, meaning that there's less energy loss compared to converting
            the linear motion of a piston into the rotational motion to spin the tires. If you pay attention to the edge of the rotor (the spinning triangle)
            labeled A and the gear on the inside (representing the eccentric shaft) labeled B, you'll notice that B spins 3 times for every rotation A makes.
        </p>
        <p> This means that while each individual combustion is smaller, (the volume of each of the two combustion chamber in the 13B is 650 cubic centimeters) the increased
            frequency of the combustions lead to the rotary engine having an incredibly linear power curve. In fact, one rotor has a power stroke twice as often as a cylinder
            of a piston engine!
