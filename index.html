        a big need to subdivide the page into separate sections quite yet.-->

        <p>Welcome to my (Richard Gaal's) website! Its dedicated to rotary engines and the Mazda RX-8. My goal is for this to be a "one stop shop" 
            for information about the RX-8. Things I plan to host here include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A brief description of rotar engines and how they compare to normal piston engines.</li>
            <li>The rotary-specific things you have to keep in mind to keep the engine healthy</li>
            <li>How to perform basic maintenance and some (easyish) longevity modifications</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Documents</h2>
        <!--I'm aware we should TRY to avoid linking to outside websites to prevent link rot, but I have it linked because I'm not sure how to link a download in HTML yet. 
            My eventual plan is to have that link be a download (or a link to a subpage of download links!) however for now the external website will have to do.-->
        <p>While you would ideally have a physical owner's manual, these cars are over 20 years old at this point and there's a chance 
            that the original manual your car came with is loooong gone at this point. <a href="https://rotaryheads.com/PDF/RX8/">Here</a> is a place you can find a 
            digital copy of the owner's manual, as well as some other useful documents.</p>
