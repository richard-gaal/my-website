        <p>Welcome to my (Richard Gaal's) website! It's dedicated to rotary engines and the Mazda RX-8. My goal is for this to be a "one stop shop" 
            for information about the RX-8. Things I plan to host here include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A brief description of rotary engines and how they compare to normal piston engines.</li>
            <li>The rotary-specific things you have to keep in mind to keep the engine healthy</li>
            <li>How to perform basic maintenance and some (easyish) longevity modifications</li>
            <li>Accepting that no matter what you do with the car, the engine will eventually need to be replaced</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>A Brief History of the RX-8</h2>
            <p>While Mazda had used a rotary engine decades before the RX-8 entered production, the RX-8 specifically started development with the RX-01 concept car,
                unveiled by Mazda in the 1995 Tokyo Motor Show, <sup><a href="#ref_1" class="references">[1]</a></sup> featuring 
                an early version of the 13B-MSP engine <sup><a href="#ref_2" class="references">[2]</a></sup> that would later evolve into the Renesis engine used in the RX-8. </p>

            <p> The multi side port (or MSP for short) engine would differ from previous Mazda rotary engines in one significant manner (elaborated upon 
                <a href="howitworks.html">here)</a>, and while the engine did have its perks, it is also the root of the reliability issues that the RX-8 is known for.</p>

            <p> Compared to its predecessor the FD RX-7, the RX-8 was designed to be more of a grand tourer than a stripped-down race car. As such, it weighs ~300 lbs
                more and makes ~45 hp less than its top specced older sibling. This power difference comes from the fact Mazda went away from the problematic sequential turbos of the FD
                and instead opted to make the engine naturally aspirated. The switch back to NA from the FD RX-7 was because Mazda had to adjust the locations of the exhaust ports
                (again elaborated upon more <a href="howitworks.html">here)</a> and adding forced induction would've made the car more unreliable than it already is.</p>
            <p> The RX-8 ended development in 2012...

            <h2>Documents</h2>
            <p>While you would ideally have a physical owner's manual, these cars are over 20 years old at this point and there's a chance 
                that the original manual your car came with is <em>loooong</em> gone at this point. <a href="https://rotaryheads.com/PDF/RX8/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a place you can find a 
                digital copy of the owner's manual, as well as some other useful documents.</p>
